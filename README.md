This homepage was a project assigned in The Odin Project curriculum. The project directions can be found here, though I did opt for some minor design changes: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage#project-solution

The purpose of this project was to create a homepage/portfolio for my work that was responsive when viewed on different screen sizes (e.g. phone, tablet, laptop). I utilized features such as media queries, transformations, flexbox, and grid to develop this dynamic website. Learning about responsive design was a game changer for me and is something I will be incorporating in my projects going forward.
